      <img class="img" src="soccer.jpg" alt="" width="250px">
      <p>Arsenal's hopes of reaching their first UEFA Champions League final since 2006 were dashed by Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in a dramatic semi-final tie. The Gunners faced a 1-0 deficit from the first leg at the Emirates Stadium, where Ousmane Dembélé's early goal had given PSG the advantage. In the return leg at Parc des Princes, Arsenal's performance was commendable, but they fell short, losing 2-1 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate. Fabian Ruiz opened the scoring for PSG in the 27th minute, and despite a spirited response from Arsenal, Achraf Hakimi sealed the victory with a goal in the 72nd minute. Bukayo Saka pulled one back for Arsenal in the 76th minute, but it wasn't enough to overturn the deficit.</p>
